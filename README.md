# Bem Vindo ao NoKicks!

This is an Utopic system we built to guide and show all students and people of UFABC how the enrollment on disciplines can one day be easy-to-use and of course user friendly.

The system was programmed in Node.JS, AngularJS, used MongoDB for the database and Google's Material Design for the UI.

###Pre-Requisites


### Usage

#### Live system testing
The system is right now live(06/21/16) for some time to simulate how the users would interact with the platform and test it.

#### OffLine Testing
If you want to check it out on your machine cause it's not live anymore, do the following things:
Make sure you have Node.JS and MongoDB installed on your computer.
On the Project folder run:
- `npm install`
To install all the project dependencies.
- `npm start`
To run the code and start the server.

### Example
This comes preloaded with a "Pets" controller and full REST Api.
Check those routes:
- `localhost:3000/api/ping`

- `localhost:3000/api/pets/create?name=meaw&race=Bulldog`
- `localhost:3000/api/pets`

## It's just this? Where is the rest?
Calm down! There's more things to come. We are making our best to document this the right way, but we are shure you awesome developers who got here can help us without more guidelines!
